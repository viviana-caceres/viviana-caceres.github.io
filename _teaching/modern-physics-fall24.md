I was a teaching assistant for Introduction to Modern Physics for Physics/Astronomy majors. I led weekly recitations, held office hours to answer students' questions, and graded their homework assignments.

Course Description
======
Relativity and quantum theory with applications to selected topics in atomic, molecular, solid state, or nuclear physics. This course covers much of the modern physics curriculum focusing on special relativity, the concepts and mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics in one- and three-dimensional model systems, and some applications of quantum theory to modern topics such as atomic/molecular, nuclear, particle, condensed matter physics or astrophysics as time permits. The course is a prerequisite for a upper level courses in physics and astronomy majors, and in particular quantum mechanics.
