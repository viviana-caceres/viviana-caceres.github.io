To study materials undergoing metal-insulator transitions, we developed an automated system for resistivity and Hall measurements using an Arduino-controlled switching circuit and LabVIEW interface. This setup serves as a low-cost alternative for measuring resistivity using the van der Pauw method and was successfully tested on V₂O₃ thin films. Our results not only captured the metal-insulator transition around 100–115 K but also produced Hall effect data consistent with commercial systems.
